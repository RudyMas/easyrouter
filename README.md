# An easy way to process clean URLs with added routing options

## Installation
Install the package using composer.
```
composer require rudymas/router
```

or by editing composer.json yourself and adding:
```
"require": {
    "rudymas/router": "*"
}
```

You can also set a certain version instead of *, of course.

## Usage example
